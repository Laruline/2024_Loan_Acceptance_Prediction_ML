- **Jupyter Notebook**: (https://github.com/Laruline/2024_Loan_Acceptance_Prediction_ML/blob/main/Loan_Prediction_ML.ipynb)
- **Goal**: Use machine-learning to predict loan acceptance for a bank.
- **Description**: The dataset contains 13 columns of public data about loans details and status. The project steps include: API connection to kaggle, jupyter notebook connection, data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization, Train-Test Split, model and fitting, testing (accuracy, precision, recall, f1), fine-tuning.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization, machine learning.
- **Technology**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingo, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, GridSearchCV, Feature Importance.
- **Results**: Approved loans are predicted at 92%, while rejected loans are predicted at 72%. A high recall has been favoured here to avoid losing potential "good" clients with a risk of having a few "bad" clients being approved instead of rejected. the fine-tuning is subjective and highly dependant on business' requieries and wishes.
